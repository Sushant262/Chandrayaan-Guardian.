# Chandrayaan-Guardian

Chandrayaan Guardian is a fun to play 2D Game.

The game opens with the Main Menu and when we hit the play Button the intense fun starts.

Its a endless firing tower(Chandrayaan) defense game with score and lives shown in the top left corner of the game.

You can  switch between the Player and the Chandrayaan Rocket just by pressing a Button (H) and again get out of the Chandrayaan by pressing (J).

You can shoot with the Chandrayaan machine gun which has greater fire rate than the robot, but it has a cooldown as the machine gun gets overheated.
Then we need to switch to the robot in order to protect the Chandrayaan from various small and large asteroids.
