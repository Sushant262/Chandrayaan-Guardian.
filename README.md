# Chandrayaan-Guardian

Chandrayaan Guardian is a fun to play 2D Game.

The game opens with the Main Menu and when we hit the play Button the intensity and fun starts.

Its a endless firing tower(Chandrayaan) defense game with score and lives shown in the top left corner of the game.

You can  switch between the Robot and the Chandrayaan Rocket just by pressing a Button (H) and again get out of the Chandrayaan by pressing (J).

You can shoot with the Chandrayaan machine gun which has greater mobility and fire rate than the Robot but, it has a cooldown as the machine gun gets overheated.
Then we need to switch to the Robot in order to protect the Chandrayaan from various small and large asteroids.

The Robot has 3 Lives. The Lives of the Robot are shown at the top left corner.
Chandrayaan has a certain amount of health(hp) which we can track with the help of the health bar at the top right corner.
The health of the Chandrayaan reduces after each hit of the asteroid and the Robot also loses his Life after collision/hit with the asteroid.

If the Chandrayaan loses all its health(hp) or if the Robot loses all of its Lives then................GAME OVER.
